# NLP Group 15 Text Similarity

## How to test each notebook
1. Download the MSR Paraphrase Dataset (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52398)
2. Create a folder in your Google Drive, name it msr_paraphrase, and drag-and-drop all the files from the downloaded archive there
3. Create 4 empty folders and name them tfidf_model, w2v_model, d2v_model, and text_similarity
4. Run each notebook separately to test whether it works.
5. The most updated models are DocToVec_NN.ipynb (for Doc2Vec model), Tf_idf_NN.ipynb (for TF-IDF model), WordToVector_NN.ipynb (for Word2Vec Model), nick_bert_text_similarity_updated.ipynb (for BERT model), text_similarity_ensemble.ipynb (for the combination ensemble model).
